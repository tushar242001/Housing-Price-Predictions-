Housing Price Prediction 


In this project, you are going to design a housing price prediction model.
You are given a training dataset called housing_train.csv
For each house in this dataset, you have the following information:
1. houseID - this is just an identifier. It's used to identify a given house, as such please discard it for your model
2. price - the price of the house
3. area - the area of the house
4. bedrooms - no. of bedrooms in the house
5. bathrooms - no of bathrooms in the house
6. stories - no of floors in the house
7. mainroad - whether the house is on the mainroad or not
8. guestroom - whether the house has a guestroom or not
9. basement - whether the house has a basement or not
10. hotwaterheating - whether the house has heating for water or not
11. airconditioning - whether the house has air conditioning or not
12. parking - no. of parking in the housing
13. prefarea - is this area a preferred area in the neighbourhood?
14. furnishingstatus - the furnishing status of the house
Your task
You must predict the housing prices for the houses mentioned in house_test.csv and produce a new file predictions.csv
The predictions.csv file should only have 2 columns: house_id and predicted. Here the predicted column contains the predicted prices of the mentioned house_id
For example, if the house_test.csv data set has the following houses:
houseID
	area
	bedrooms
	bathrooms
	stories
	mainroad
	guestroom
	basement
	hotwaterheating
	airconditioning
	parking
	prefarea
	furnishingstatus
	H94
	4500
	3
	2
	2
	no
	no
	yes
	no
	yes
	0
	no
	semi-furnished
	R16
	4040
	2
	1
	1
	yes
	no
	no
	no
	no
	0
	no
	unfurnished
	B81
	6600
	3
	2
	1
	yes
	no
	yes
	no
	yes
	0
	yes
	unfurnished
	





then your prediction could look like this:




houseID
	predicted
	H94
	6640500.415
	R16
	3188282.375
	B81
	7782125.573
	The predictions.csv file must be generated by you. And it must have only the 2 mentioned columns
Input/Output
1. Input: housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv already exist. You can simply read them in your solution
2. Output: Generate a file called predictions.csv with the required format and data
