## Features
- Predicts housing prices based on multiple features.
- Uses a linear regression model for prediction.
- Provides insights into the importance of different features.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd housing-price-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the model for predicting housing prices, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. Run the prediction script:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input your-dataset.csv --output predictions.csv
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. You can download the dataset from [link to dataset].

## Model
The linear regression model is implemented using Python's scikit-learn library. The key steps involved are:
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
2. Model training: Training the linear regression model on the preprocessed dataset.
3. Model evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

## Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X.XX
- R-squared: X.XX
