# Housing-Price-Predictions
In this project, we create a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses in the Boston Area.

Given to us is a dataset called housing_train.csv which contains attributes of each house: houseId, price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishing status

Given this, data and a series of new houses stored in housing_test.csv , our model produces a file predictions.csv containing houseID and predicted prices for each house.

Using Linear Regression, we are able to reach a 70% accuracy in predictions.

This project is part of the Edyst Internship Program.
